#   Installation    #
#####################
Linux 32- and 64-bit and Windows (32-bit) binaries are included in the Git
repository (/bin/ folder).  Each have -x86,-amd64, or .exe respectively.   If
you are unsure which Linux binary you need, download the -x86 version.  These
are ready to use, 'right out of the box', with no other action needed.
(Binaries compiled with FreeBASIC version 1.02.1)


If you are adventurous and would rather compile it yourself, follow these in-
stuctions (assuming you already have the FreeBASIC compiler - version 1.02.1 or
lower is suggested):

Download the source tarball (.tar.gz file) and extract to where ever you would
like to keep the files (Windows users can use 7-zip or a variety of other
utilities to unpack the archive).

Open a terminal (Linux) or command window (Windows) in the folder that was
created extracting the archive (which should be named something like
'GematriaFBC-1.x-src').

To compile on Linux:
fbc ./GematriaFBC.bas

To compile on Windows:
fbc GematriaFBC.bas

#  Running the Program  #
#########################
Linux:
It is suggested to make a symbolic link to the binary in /home/foo/bin/, that
way the program can be run from anywhere.
Also suggested is to remove the suffix from the binary name (i.e. the '-x86' or
'-amd64'), however it will still work without doing so.  For example:
$ ln -s /home/foo/downloaded/path/GematriaFBC /home/foo/bin/GematriaFBC

Windows:
Double click the .exe or call the program from the command prompt.


Usage:
     -h, --help              Show options
     -v, --version           Show version
     -l, --log               Log session (as GematriaFBC.log)
     -w, --warranty          Warranty and license conditions
     -V, --verbose           Verbose output

#  General Information  #
#########################
Enter a phrase to find the gematria.  Enter !q to quit or !clr to clear the
screen.
Gives Simple English, Regular English, Jewish, Septenary, Chaldean, Pythagorean
and Reduced. (For now - though additional systems as well as reverse systems
will likely be added in future).

Note that in a Linux (ANSI emulated) terminal, the verbose option comes at a
cost of speed, but will display the entered string and then letter values in a
sum format.  This is good for those whose are learning the values of letters in
the different systems.  If you're running under Linux, and would like better
performance, switch to a true text-only console (TTY).

As of version 1.0, the program will calculate dates and numbers, which had
previously been ignored.
