respectively).

#########################
#  General Information  #
#########################
A port of the classic TI-Extended-BASIC/Myarc-BASIC (TIXB/MXB) program,
LIBRARY-x. This one however introduces some new functions, such as custom file-
names and a record deleting ability (rather than having to overwrite a record).
Also noteworthy is the fact that the search abilities are much more powerful
given the string comparing abilities of FreeBASIC.

As of version 0.2, up to ~65000 books can be entered.  The following limitations
still apply to the lengths of fields in each record (book):
TITLES may be up to 109 characters in length
AUTHORS may be up to 19 characters in length (individually)
SUBJECTS may be up to 4 characters in length
NOTES may be up to 29 characters in length

######################
#  Navigation Notes  #
######################
If a menu option is selected by accident, to return to the main menu TYPE
'<back>' (no quotes) IF THE INPUT IS supposed to be A STRING, OTHERWISE for
NUMERIC INPUT, TYPE '-1' (no quotes).

##########################
#  Updating the Catalog  #
##########################
This program no longer relies on a built-in filename, though one still exists.
Enter '<def>' (no quotes) for the default filename (catalog.dat).  Otherwise
enter the name desired, if no path is given, then the path will be the one the
main program was launched from.
Updating is fairly straightforward,  just enter the number of records to add,
then enter the data.  Up to three authors per title may be entered.  The FILE
IS *APPENDED* when finished.

##########################################
#  Sorting Catalog and Deleting Records  #
##########################################
Sorting the catalog will sort by title (TIT), which is the first field of each
record in CAT.  Starting with version 0.1, all preceeding articles are ignored
while sorting, giving a truly alphabetized catalog.dat.  The FILE IS NOT SAVED
when finished.
To delete a record, enter the record number.  That can be found by searching
the title (the last number printed before an item is displayed is the record
number).  The FILE IS NOT SAVED when finished.

####################
#  About Subjects  #
####################
This section of the program will take some adjustments to suite personal needs.
Since this is much more flexible than any previous versions in TIXB/MXB, the
sky is the limit.  By default, a three character system is deployed, for
example:  MUSic, ART, PoeTrY, REFerence.  However anything could be used, as
long as a convention is followed.  To display your own subjects, see lines 12-
14 of the Subject Search unit (searchSubject.bas) and recompile.

#######################
#  General searching  #
#######################
As previously stated, this FreeBASIC version of Library Master is much more power-
ful when it comes to searching.  While previously an exact phrase match had to
exist, now one can enter 'calculus' and get all the books with the word
'calculus' in the title.  This does mean however that one has to be careful not
to enter some single word like 'the' without expecting a lot of results!  ;DD
