#  Usage  #
###########
Since so much aviation data are split between SI and BS systems, it is nice to
have something to facilitate such conversions.   This is where fgConvert comes
in handy.

Designed with FGFS in mind, and all the tools used with it, such as Marble,
which gives elevations in meters and distances in kilometers.  Converts degrees
in decimal to degrees in DMS form and from DMS to decimal.

Also helps calculate the descent distance for angles of descent between 5⁹ and
10⁰.
