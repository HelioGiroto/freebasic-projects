*********************
*   Installation    *
*********************
Linux 32- and 64-bit and Windows (32-bit) binaries are included in the Git
repository (Lin-Regressor-x86,Lin-Regressor-amd64,and Lin-Regressor.exe,
respectively).

To compile on Linux:
fbc ./Lin-Regressor.bas ./Lin-Regressor.xpm

To compile on Windows:
fbc -s gui Lin-Regressor.bas Lin-Regressor.rc

(Binaries compiled with FB version 1.02.1)

It may come up that the window is too tall.  In that case make the following 3
changes:

1) & 2) from Lin-Regress.bas; Lines 56 & 57 change to:
ScreenRes 640,480,32                                   ' Short window
Width 640\8, 480\8 ' 8x8 characters, 80columnsx60rows  ' Short window

3) from calcNplot.bas; Line 92 change to:
View (10, 64) - (630, 312),RGB(0,0,0),RGB(0,255,255)  ' Short window

***************************
*** GENERAL INFORMATION ***
***************************
Thank you for taking a look at Lin-Regressor-0.1.  Lin-Regressor-0.1 can
perform a least squares linear regression on data points that you enter or load
from a plain text file.

**************************
*** WRITING DATA FILES ***
**************************
If you decide to write a data file to load, there must be at least *one* space
between the independent and dependent variables, and the independent variable
must start at column 2 (single space), and not exceed column 40. The last digit
of the dependent variable should not exceed column 80.

For example:

 5.034 10.3
 6.73  15.23
 7.54  18.65
...etc

would be three acceptable rows, while:

   5.034 10.3
   6.73 15.23
   7.54 18.65
   ...etc

	* OR *

5.0340203289834793240093908913090120212131 10.30840239809342342343984
6.730034324239483209840392843902803928402398439 15.2309843732790342
7.540980398403893209374093740374932748362387 18.65039473473289739873343
...etc

would not be acceptable.  (The latter example being rather pointless anyway).

Other than to follow those rules for data files, you can pretty much be as
sloppy as you'd like in making them, the program will figure out the rest :).

******************************
*** EXPORTING OUTPUT FILES ***
******************************
When the program has finished calculating the regression, it will give you the
option to export an output file.
